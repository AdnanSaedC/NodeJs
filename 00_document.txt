backend is nothing but how server and database interact with each other

server is a softaware which serves 24*7

server communicates through port (which is nothing but hardware + softeare which allows transfer of data)

javascript can't able to access file since it was designed for browser

nodejs gives javascipt all these powers and it is possible because it is bundle of javascript 
and other third party services like lubuv (which is written in c and helps in I/O commmunication),crypto

nodejs and npm are two diiferent things 

so nodejs helps you run js without browser thus it helps in other tings also
like file management,networks,os etc (which browser can't)
and npm is used to just download,update,share and manage node packges

remember nodejs is an engine which helps to use a language called js
